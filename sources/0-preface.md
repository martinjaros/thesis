# Preface

Augmented reality technologies have been around for a while [@Bimber2005],
however their implementation in embedded systems were not possible until recently.
Navigation applications require a broad spectrum of functionality such as video processing,
accelerated graphical rendering and of course the navigation itself.
With public access to the global satellite navigation systems such as GPS or GLONASS,
precise position determination is possible worldwide.
Advances in sensor technologies offer many small and effective devices,
such as gyroscopes, compasses, accelerometers or barometers.
The augmented reality navigation provides the future of spatial navigation systems,
delivering all necessary information to the user in the most clear way
by projecting it directly to the visible world.
Users do not have to search for the information in specialized devices or multifunction displays,
they will just see it floating around, related to where they look.
Applications include automotive, aeronautical or personal navigation.

This work provides foundation on all aspects of designing such system.
The first chapter specifies requirements and limitations for the project.
The second chapter deals with the application design,
it is divided per each individual subsystem.
The third chapter specifies hardware details and platform realization.
