### Communication

Systems such GPS uses numerous satellites orbiting Earth transmitting their position and time.
Receiver can measure its position and time with accuracy based on number of satellites in view.
GPS receivers usually communicate via serial line, Linux kernel features TTY module originally used for teletypewriters.
It handles serial lines, converters and virtual lines with devices generally called `/dev/tty*`.
Serial connections (UART, RS-232) are usually named `/dev/ttySn`, where `n` is a device number.
Emulated connection are named `/dev/ttyUSBn` for USB emulators or `/dev/ttyACMn` for modem emulators.
There are also pseudo terminals in `/dev/pts/` used for software emulation.
This devices allows standard I/O and may be controlled with functions defined in `termios.h` or by using [stty(1)][stty] utility.
Important physical interface settings are

* baud rate
* parity
* flow control

Usual settings are 4800 or 38 400 baud with no parity and no flow control,
without proper interface configuration, no communication will occur
Driver further provides line processing before passing data to the application.
Important line settings are

* newline handling
* echo mode
* canonical mode
* timeouts and buffer sizes

In canonical mode, driver uses line buffer and allows line editing.
Buffer is passed to the application (made readable) after new line is encountered.
It may be combined with echo mode, which will automatically send received characters back.
This is how standard console line works, however if application needs to be in full control,
driver may be switched to raw mode with per-character buffers and echo disabled.
Also specific control characters for canonical mode may be configured.

GPS receivers uses [NMEA 183 standard][nmea0183] [@NMEA0183]. Communication is done in sentences,
each message starts with dollar sign followed by source name and sentence type,
then there is comma separated list of data fields optionally terminated by a checksum.
Each sentence is appended with carriage return and new line. For example in sentence

`$GPGGA,000000,4914.266,N,01638.583,E,1,8,1,257,M,46.43,M,,*46`{.perl}

`GP` is source name (GPS receiver), `GGA` is sentence type (fix information), `*46` is a checksum and rest are data fields.
Checksum is delimited by asterisk and consist of two character hexadecimal number calculated as bitwise XOR of all character between dollar and asterisk.
Note that fields may be empty (as last two fields in the example) and numbers may have fractional parts.

### Navigation

As Earth shape is very complex, there are two layers of approximation used for computing position.
Geoid is the equipotential surface, which describes mean ocean level if Earth was fully covered with water.
Most recent geoid model is EGM96 which is used together with [WGS84 reference ellipsoid][wgs84] [@WGS84].
This ellipsoid has semi-major axis of $a = 6378137$ meters and flattening $f = 1/298.257223563$.
Note that ellipsoid flattening is defined as

$f = \dfrac{a - b}{a}$,

where *b* is the semi-minor axis. The eccentricity is defined as

$e = 2f - f^2$.

Geodetic latitude $\varphi$ is the angle between normal to the reference ellipsoid and the equator,
longitude $\lambda$ is the angle between normal to the reference ellipsoid and the prime meridian.
Because of the flattening, the normal does not intersect ellipsoid center.
Geocentric latitude $\psi$ uses line running through the center instead of the normal,

$\psi = \arctan [ (1-e)^2 \tan(\varphi)]$.

Device position measured by GPS is defined by its geodetic latitude, longitude and altitude

$h_{AMSL} = h_{WGS84} - h_{EGM96}$

measured as height above mean see level, where $h_{WGS84}$ is the height above reference ellipsoid and
$h_{EGM96}$ is the height above geoid. As GPS sensors usually send fix information at low rates,
position needs to be interpolated between fixes.
If current ground speed $v_{GND}$ and course $\alpha_{TRK}$ are known, the interpolated position in next step will be

$\varphi_{(t+1)} = \varphi_{(t)} + \dfrac{\cos(\alpha_{TRK}) \cdot v_{GND} \cdot _\Delta t}{R_{(\varphi)}}$,

$\lambda_{(t+1)} = \lambda_{(t)} + \dfrac{\sin(\alpha_{TRK}) \cdot v_{GND} \cdot _\Delta t}{R_{(\varphi)} \cdot \cos(\varphi)}$,

where *R* is the ellipsoid radius at given latitude

$R = \dfrac{\sqrt{b^4 \sin(\varphi)^2 + a^4 \cos(\varphi)^2}}{\sqrt{b^2 \sin(\varphi)^2 + a^2 \cos(\varphi)^2}}$.

Application needs to know projections of specific landmarks as normalized horizontal and
vertical coordinates (in range of -1 to 1) used for rendering

$\begin{bmatrix} x \cdot FOV_x \\ y \cdot FOV_y \end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\gamma_{dev}) & -\sin(\gamma_{dev}) \\ \sin(\gamma_{dev}) & \cos(\gamma_{dev})  \end{bmatrix}
\times
\begin{bmatrix} \alpha_{proj} - \alpha_{dev} \\ \beta_{proj} - \beta_{dev} \end{bmatrix}
$,

where *FOV* is the field of view, *dev* means device angle (calculated by [inertial subsystem (2.4)](#inertial-measurement-subsystem)) and
*proj* means projection angle (defined later on in this section).
Orthodrome (great circle) is the intersection of a sphere and a plane passing though its center.
However, because Earth flattening is rather small, it may be used as an approximation for a curve following Earth surface,
connecting two points with shortest route. [Spherical trigonometry][sphtrig] [@SphTrig] defines basis for orthodrome calculations.
Heading changes along the route and its initial value is the horizontal projection angle

$\alpha_{proj} = \arctan \left ( \dfrac{\sin(\lambda - \lambda_0) \cos(\varphi)}
{\cos(\varphi_0) \sin(\varphi) - \sin(\varphi_0) \cos(\varphi) \cos(\lambda - \lambda_0)} \right )$,

the zero index refers to the device coordinate. Angular distance between those two points is

$\phi = \arccos(\sin(\varphi_0) \sin(\varphi) + \cos(\varphi_0) \cos(\varphi) \cos(\lambda - \lambda_0))$.

Vertical projection angle is the angle between the horizon (perpendicular to normal) and
a line directly connecting the points.
Lets construct a triangle connecting the points with the center of the reference ellipsoid,
assuming zero flattening, so the normals have intersection in the center ($f = 0 \rightarrow e = 0 \rightarrow \psi = \varphi$).

$a_\Delta = h_0 + R_{(\varphi_0)}$,

$b_\Delta = h + R_{(\varphi)}$,

$c_\Delta = \sqrt{a_\Delta^2 + b_\Delta^2 - 2 a_\Delta b_\Delta \cos(\phi)}$,

$\beta_{proj} = \arcsin \left ( \dfrac{b_\Delta}{c_\Delta} \sin(\phi) \right ) - \frac{\pi}{2}$,

where *h* is height above reference ellipsoid.
These calculations are quite complex and there is plenty of room for approximation.
Over short distance, such as typical in visual ranges, orthodromes may be replaced with loxodromes (rhumb lines).
Loxodrome is a curve following Earth surface, connecting two points with constant heading.
It has similar path to orthodrome, if the points are relatively far from poles a close together.
Simplified heading along the line is

$\alpha_{proj} \doteq \arctan \left ( \dfrac{\lambda \cos(\varphi) - \lambda_0 \cos(\varphi_0)}{\varphi - \varphi_0} \right )$.

Note that loxodrome approximation will fail horribly near poles as the curve will run circles around the pole.
Angular distance along loxodrome is

$\phi \doteq \sqrt{(\varphi - \varphi_0)^2 + (\lambda \cos(\varphi) - \lambda_0 \cos(\varphi_0))^2}$

and a horizontal distance along the arc between those points is

$d = \phi \cdot R_{(\varphi_0)}$,

assuming flattening difference is close to zero, so *R* is constant along the curve.
With the approximation of local flat Earth surface perpendicular to the normal, the simplified vertical projection angle is

$\beta_{proj} \doteq \arctan \left ( \dfrac{h - h_0}{d} \right )$.

This approximation will fail at higher altitudes when the visibility range is high enough to make the Earth curvature observable.
